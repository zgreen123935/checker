Highlight key installation considerations or potential issues.\n\n**Guidance for Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Identify Thermostat Wiring**\n- Remove the thermostat cover to inspect wiring terminals.\n- Note terminal labels and corresponding wire colors (e.g., R, Rc, Rh, W1, W2, Y1, Y2, C, G, O/B).\n- Count the number of connected wires and their respective terminals.\n\n**Step 2: Confirm System Voltage**\n- Verify that the system operates on 24V (low voltage) by checking the HVAC system's control board or user manual.\n- Identify wire types: thin, multicolored wires indicate low voltage; thicker wires (black or red) suggest high voltage (120V/240V).\n\n**Step 3: Check for a Common (C) Wire**\n- Look for a wire connected to the terminal labeled 'C', which provides continuous power for smart thermostats.\n- If absent, consider the feasibility of adding a C wire or using a Mysa Power Adapter (if available).\n\n**Step 4: Identify HVAC System Type**\n- Determine if the system is:\n  - Conventional (Forced Air): single- or multi-stage heating/cooling.\n  - Heat Pump: utilizes a reversing valve for heating and cooling; presence of O or B wire.\n- Note additional accessories such as humidifiers, dehumidifiers, or ventilators.\n- Assess the number of heating and cooling stages, typically indicated by W1, W2 (heating) and Y1, Y2 (cooling) terminals."
